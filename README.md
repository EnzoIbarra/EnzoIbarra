Hi! I'm Enzo, a full stack web developer based in Córdoba, Argentina.  
I specialize in frontend development, crafting responsive, clean, and functional user interfaces using modern technologies.  
As part of my web development training, I’ve developed strong competencies in UX/UI, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Node.js, Express, React, Next.js, SQL, and Tailwind CSS.

📚 Before tech, I studied English Language & Literature at university for over a year and have been working since January 2017 in the production sector, gaining over 8 years of experience.  
This journey has equipped me with strong skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability, all of which now fuel the way I build and collaborate in tech.

### 🧠 Additional Skills & Experience

**🇬🇧 English Proficiency**  
Studied English Language & Literature for over a year at university.  

**🧪 Testing & Code Quality**  
Basic hands-on experience with Jest for unit testing in earlier projects.  
I understand core testing concepts and am gradually incorporating test coverage in my workflows to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

**☁️ Deploy & Hosting**  
Experienced with deploying full stack applications:  
• Used **Render** for full stack deployment (Nest.js + Next.js)  
• Used **Vercel** for frontend hosting (*Comercio Libre*)  
• Familiar with environment variables, build processes, and production configs

**🧩 Soft Skills in Tech Contexts**  
My 8+ years in production environments shaped a strong foundation in discipline, ownership, and team collaboration.  
In tech, I apply these values through:  
• Writing clean, maintainable code and documenting it for teammates  
• Giving and receiving feedback during code reviews and pair programming  
• Taking initiative and full ownership of features from planning to release  
• Communicating progress and blockers clearly in remote settings
