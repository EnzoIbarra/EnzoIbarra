💡 Building tech with purpose and clarity  

Hi! I'm Enzo, a full stack web developer based in Córdoba, Argentina 🇦🇷  
I specialize in frontend development, crafting responsive, clean and functional user interfaces using modern technologies.

📚 Before tech, I studied English Language & Literature at university for over a year and have been working since January 2017 in the production sector, gaining over 8 years of experience.
This journey has equipped me with strong skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability, all of which now fuel the way I build and collaborate in tech.

🛠 Tech Stack  
Languages: JavaScript · TypeScript  
Frontend: React · Next.js · Tailwind CSS · CSS Modules  
Backend: Node.js · Express · PostgreSQL · TypeORM · Nest.js
Tools: Git · GitHub · Axios · Insomnia · Figma · ESLint · Prettier  

🧠 Additional Skills & Experience

🇬🇧 English Proficiency  
Studied English Language & Literature for over a year at university.I recently completed an intermediate-level English course and spent 6 months living in the UK, strengthening my communication skills in real contexts. While I don't hold an official certification, I operate comfortably in technical and professional environments, likely at a B1–B2 level.

🧪 Testing & Code Quality  
Basic hands-on experience with Jest for unit testing in earlier projects. I understand core testing concepts and am gradually incorporating test coverage in my workflows to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

☁️ Deploy & Hosting  
Experienced with deploying full stack applications.  
• Used **Render** for full stack deployment (Nest.js + Next.js).  
• Previously used **Vercel** to host frontend projects like *Comercio Libre*.  
• Familiar with environment variables, build processes, and production configs.

🧩 Soft Skills in Tech Contexts  
My 8+ years in production environments shaped a strong foundation in discipline, ownership, and team collaboration. In tech, I apply these values through:  
• Writing clean, maintainable code and documenting it for teammates.  
• Giving and receiving feedback during code reviews and pair programming.  
• Taking initiative and full ownership of features from planning to release.  
• Communicating progress and blockers clearly in remote settings.

✨ What I value  
🧠 Critical thinking & problem solving  
💻 Clean code & continuous improvement  
🤝 Communication & team collaboration  
📦 Real-world experience in productive environments  
🌱 Curiosity & self-learning
